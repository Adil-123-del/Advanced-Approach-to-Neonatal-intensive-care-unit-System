# Advanced-Approach-to-Neonatal-intensive-care-unit-System
#The preterm infant care is one of the most important, delegate and sensitive areas in the Biomedical field. 
#Preterm baby requires a surrounding exactly similar as in the womb to cope with the external environment. 
#To provide a similar environment as in the womb infants have to be kept in a device known as Incubator.
# An infant incubator provides stable levels of
 temperature, relative humidity. 
#Air temperature has to be maintained at a fixed temp. 
#The
 purpose of this project is to design and implement a control system to regulate and mainly
 monitor the various parameters inside the incubator or baby cradle. 
#Also, it is used to monitor
 and control the temp and humidity in the incubator. 
#Microcontroller will be used for
 implementing the hardware. The closed loop control system is a combination of sensors and
 actuators that operates synchronously to provide a stable thermal environment inside the
incubator. 
#The system keeps on checking various parameters in a real time incubator or baby
 cradle and will inform the admin about all values of the baby cradle globally.
